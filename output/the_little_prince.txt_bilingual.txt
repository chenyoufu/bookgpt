The Little Prince
I Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest.
It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal.
Here is a copy of the drawing.
Boa
In the book it said:
"Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it.
After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion."
I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing.
My Drawing Number One.
It looked something like this:
Sombrero
I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them.
But they answered: "Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?"
My drawing was not a picture of a hat.
It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant.

我六岁时，在一本名为《真实自然故事》的书中，看到了一幅壮丽的图片，关于原始森林。
这是一张描绘蟒蛇正在吞食一只动物的图片。
这是那幅图的复制本。
蟒蛇
书上写道：
“蟒蛇会整个吞下猎物，而不咀嚼。
在那之后，它们就无法移动，会沉睡六个月用来消化。”
于是，我深思熟虑丛林的冒险故事。在用彩色铅笔绘画了一段时间之后，我成功地画出了我的第一幅图画。
我的第一张画。
它看起来有点像这样：
草帽
我向成年人展示了我的杰作，并问他们是否被这幅画吓到了。
但他们回答说：“吓到？为什么会有人被一个帽子吓到呢？”
我的画并不是一幅帽子的图片。
它是描绘一只蟒蛇消化一头大象的画。

But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of a boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly.
They always need to have things explained.
My Drawing Number Two looked like this:
Boa


但是由于成年人不能理解它，我又画了一幅图：我画了一条蟒蛇的内部，这样成年人就可以清楚地看到它了。
他们总是需要有事情被解释。
我的第二幅画看起来是这样的：
蟒蛇
